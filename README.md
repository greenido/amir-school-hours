[Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) is an opinionated boilerplate for web development. Tools for building a great experience [across many devices](http://google.github.io/web-starter-kit/hello-world/) and [performance oriented](#web-performance). Helping you to stay productive following the best practices outlined in Google's [Web Fundamentals](http://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals). A solid starting point for both professionals and newcomers to the industry.

## Web Performance

Web Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box and we actively work on delivering the best [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) score and frame-rate possible.

In terms of CSS, opting to just use the minimal layout (main.css, h5bp.css) weighs in at ~7KB before modifications are made. Opting to use the Style Guide styles (the default) will take this up to ~39KB. It is your choice which path makes the most sense for your project, however notes on excluding Style Guide styles are in our gulpfile.

## Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the following browsers:

* IE9, IE10, IE11, IE Mobile 10
* FF 30, 31
* Chrome 34, 35
* Safari 7, 8
* Opera 23, 24
* iOS Safari 7, 8
